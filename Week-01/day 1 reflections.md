## 💡 Reflections

- I’m **really proud** to have completed Domain 1 so quickly. It was definitely the most intuitive material for me so far, and I felt confident on the quiz.
- Domain 1 was also one of my **highest-scoring areas** in the pre-assessment, so I know the rest may not come as easily—but I feel ready.
- TryHackMe was useful for building context, but now that I’ve finished the “Intro to Cybersecurity” room, I’m pivoting hard to **focus on CC for the rest of the week**.
- The goal is to complete **three domains total** this week if I can stay in flow.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Start **Domain 2: Incident Response, BC & DR**
- Upload the Domain 1 certificate and link in GitHub
- Keep adding to GitHub daily using structured journal templates
