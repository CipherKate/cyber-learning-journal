## Why I Started This Journal

After earning a degree in international studies and working across nonprofits, activism, museums, customer service, and administration, I’ve decided to pivot into **cybersecurity**—a field that’s in-demand, futureproof, and intellectually engaging.

This repo is my **learning journal**. It’s where I’ll:
- Track my daily/weekly progress
- Reflect on what I’ve learned
- Log key terms, commands, and takeaways
- Upload certificates, screenshots, and notes
- Showcase my growth to future employers or mentors
