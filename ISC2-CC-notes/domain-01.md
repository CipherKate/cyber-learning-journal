# ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity â€“ Domain 1 Notes
**Focus:** Security Principles, Governance, Risk Management, and Ethics

---

## Governance Elements

Organizations are guided by **regulations**, **standards**, **policies**, and **procedures**. These elements build upon each other in the following order:

1. **Regulations:** Laws from governments, e.g., HIPAA, GDPR.
2. **Standards:** Frameworks to meet regulations, e.g., ISO, NIST, IEEE.
3. **Policies:** Organizational rules derived from standards.
4. **Procedures:** Step-by-step actions to implement policies.

> Example: HIPAA mandates PHI protection. Organizations adopt standards (e.g., NIST), then implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance.

## The CIA Triad

1. **Confidentiality:** Keeping data private (e.g., encryption, MFA).
2. **Integrity:** Ensuring data is accurate and unchanged (e.g., checksums).
3. **Availability:** Making sure data is accessible when needed (e.g., redundancy).

## Risk Management

### Terminology
- **Asset:** Something valuable (data, systems, reputation).
- **Threat:** Something that exploits a vulnerability.
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness or gap in protection.
- **Attack Vector:** The method a threat uses (e.g., phishing, pickpocketing analogy).

### Risk Identification
- Ongoing process; everyone shares responsibility.
- Examples: Loose wires, unsecured laptops.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Avoid:** Don't engage in risky activities.
- **Transfer:** Insurance or outsourcing.
- **Accept:** Acknowledge without action.
- **Mitigate:** Apply controls.

## Privacy and Compliance

- **HIPAA:** U.S. law protecting health data.
- **GDPR:** EU law giving people control over their data.
- Security supports privacy, but privacy has its own legal mandates.

---

## Professional Ethics

**ISC2 Code of Ethics Canons:**
1. Protect society, public trust, and the infrastructure.
2. Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
3. Provide diligent and competent service.
4. Advance and protect the profession.

> Example: Misusing administrator rights to spy on coworkers is unethical and may violate laws.

## Authentication

- **Something you know:** Passwords
- **Something you have:** Tokens, smart cards
- **Something you are:** Biometrics

Use **multifactor authentication** for stronger protection.

---

## Quiz Highlights

- GDPR applies to individuals within the EU regardless of citizenship.
- Risk tolerance is determined by executive management.
- Policies are broad guidance documents shaped by laws and standards.
- Confidentiality relates to **secrecy** in the CIA Triad.
