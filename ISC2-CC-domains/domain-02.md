# ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity – Domain 2: Incident Response, Business Continuity, and Disaster Recovery

**Date Completed:** August 1, 2025  
**Platform:** ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity Course  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Certificate Earned:** [✔️ Domain 2 Completion PDF](../assets.md/domain2-certificate)

## Key Topics Covered

- **Incident Response (IR)**
  - Incident vs Event vs Adverse Event
  - Incident Response Plan (IRP) phases: Identify → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons Learned
  - Security Operations Center (SOC) roles and functions

- **Business Continuity (BC)**
  - Business Continuity Plan (BCP): keeping critical operations running *during* disruption
  - Business Impact Analysis (BIA): identifies system dependencies and prioritizes recovery
  - Difference between BCP and DRP

- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**
  - Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP): restoring IT systems *after* major failures
  - DRP is activated if both IR and BCP fail
  - Core tools include **data backups**, alternate site strategies, and recovery objectives

## Key Terms Learned

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Adverse Event** | Any harmful occurrence (e.g., packet flood, defacement) |
| **Zero Day** | Unknown vulnerability with no patch or signature |
| **Exploit** | An attack that takes advantage of a known weakness |
| **Breach** | Unauthorized disclosure or access of PII |
| **Intrusion** | Attempted or successful unauthorized access |
| **BIA** | Analyzes impact of disrupted systems and sets priorities |
| **IRP / BCP / DRP** | Staged response plans for cyber incidents and disruptions |

## Reflections

- This domain focuses on the **availability** piece of the CIA triad.
- I noticed the ISC2 platform sometimes **skips material** (e.g., zero day, BIA) if I show early competency — but those concepts are still **testable**. I reviewed them separately through flashcards and quizzes.
- I feel confident in distinguishing between IR, BCP, and DRP — and in identifying when each is triggered.
- Next up: **Domain 3 – Network Security** 🚀
